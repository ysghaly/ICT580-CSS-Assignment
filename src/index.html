        <h2>Stag Beetle</h2>

        <p>
          Stag beetles are a family of about 1,200 species of beetles in the
          family <i>Lucanidae</i>, currently classified in four subfamilies.
          Some species grow to over 12 centimetres (4+1/2 inches), but most to
          about 5cm (2 in).
        </p>
        <p>
          The English name is derived from the large and distinctive mandibles
          found on the males of most species, which resemble the antlers of
          stags.
        </p>
        <p>
          Male stag beetles are known for their oversize mandibles used to
          wrestle each other for favoured mating sites in a way that parallels
          the way stags fight over females. Fights may also be over food, such
          as tree sap and decaying fruits. Despite their often fearsome
          appearance, they are not normally aggressive to humans. During a
          battle the main objective is to dislodge its opponent's tarsal claws
          with its mandible, thus disrupting their balance. Because its
          mandibles are capable of exceeding its own body size, stag beetles are
          generally inefficient runners, and typically fly from one location to
          another.

        <h2>Lady Bug</h2>

        <p>
          <i>Coccinellidae</i> is a widespread family of small beetles ranging
          in size from 0.8 to 18 mm (1/32-23/32 in). The family is commonly
          known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in Great Britain and
          other parts of the English-speaking world. Entomologists prefer the
          names ladybird beetles or lady beetles as these insects are not
          classified as true bugs
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of the more than 6000 described species are generally
          considered beneficial insects, because many prey on herbivorous
          hemipterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural
          pests. Many coccinellids lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale
          insect colonies in order to ensure their larvae have an immediate food
          source.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most
          prominent are of the subfamily Epilachninae (which includes the
          Mexican bean beetle), which are herbivorous themselves. Usually,
          epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of
          grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can
          increase exponentially in years when their natural enemies, such as
          parasitoid wasps that attack their eggs, are in fewer numbers. In such
          situations, they can do major crop damage. They occur in practically
          all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical
          countries.

        <h2>Blue Mint Beetles</h2>
        <p>
          <i>Chrysolina coerulans</i>, also known as the blue mint beetle or
          blue mint leaf beetle, is a species of beetle in the family
          Chrysomelidae. It is in the subgenus of Synerga. It is native to a
          wide range of countries between mid and eastern Europe and lives
          alongside rivers and in meadows, it feeds on various plant members of
          the mint family.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was first spotted in the UK in 2011, when it was first reported to
          the Royal Horticultural Society&apos;s entomology department in July.
          In 2012, it was found breeding in Kent, Cambridgeshire and
          Lincolnshire. It has further spread throughout the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Th adult beetles are 6-10 mm (0.24-0.39 in) long,with black legs and
          antennae. It has a smooth head, without longitudinal groove,[3] and
          parallel-sided thorax. Then the pronotal disk (which is found at the
          top of the first thoracic segment) of <i>C. coerulans</i> has fine
          punctures. It has a smooth elytra (hardened forewing),[3] which is
          distinctly metallic blue, or iridescent blue.
