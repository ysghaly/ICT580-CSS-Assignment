	<h2>Stag Beetle</h2>

	<p>
		Stag beetles are a family of about 1,200 species of beetles in the family <i>Lucanidae</i>, 
		currently classified in four subfamilies. Some species grow to over 12 centimetres 
		(4+1/2 inches), but most to about 5cm (2 in).
	</p>
	<p>
		The English name is derived from the large and distinctive mandibles found on the males 
		of most species, which resemble the antlers of stags. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Male stag beetles are known for their oversize mandibles used to wrestle each other for favoured 
		mating sites in a way that parallels the way stags fight over females. Fights may also be over food, 
		such as tree sap and decaying fruits. Despite their often fearsome appearance, they are not normally 
		aggressive to humans. During a battle the main objective is to dislodge its opponent's tarsal claws 
		with its mandible, thus disrupting their balance. Because its mandibles are capable of exceeding its 
		own body size, stag beetles are generally inefficient runners, and typically fly from one location to 
		another.

	<h2>Lady Bug</h2>

	<p><i>Coccinellidae</i> is a widespread family of small beetles ranging in size from 0.8 to 18 mm (1/32-23/32 in).
		The family is commonly known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in Great Britain and other parts 
		of the English-speaking world. Entomologists prefer the names ladybird beetles or lady beetles as these insects 
		are not classified as true bugs
	</p>
	<p>The majority of the more than 6000 described species are generally considered beneficial insects, 
		because many prey on herbivorous hemipterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests.
		Many coccinellids lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies in order to ensure their 
		larvae have an immediate food source.
	</p>
	<p>		 
		However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, 
		the most prominent are of the subfamily Epilachninae (which includes the Mexican bean beetle), 
		which are herbivorous themselves. Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating 
		the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase 
		exponentially in years when their natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps that attack their 
		eggs, are in fewer numbers. In such situations, they can do major crop damage. They occur in practically 
		all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries.

	<h2>Blue Mint Beetles</h2>
	<p>
		<i>Chrysolina coerulans</i>, also known as the blue mint beetle or blue mint leaf beetle, 
		is a species of beetle in the family Chrysomelidae. It is in the subgenus of Synerga. It is 
		native to a wide range of countries between mid and eastern Europe and lives alongside rivers 
		and in meadows, it feeds on various plant members of the mint family. 
	</p>
	<p>
		It was first spotted in the UK in 2011, when it was first reported to the Royal Horticultural 
		Society&apos;s entomology department in July. In 2012, it was found breeding in Kent,
		Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire. It has further spread throughout the UK. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Th adult beetles are 6-10 mm (0.24-0.39 in) long,with black legs and antennae. It has a smooth 
		head, without longitudinal groove,[3] and parallel-sided thorax. Then the pronotal disk (which 
		is found at the top of the first thoracic segment) of <i>C. coerulans</i> has fine punctures.
		It has a smooth elytra (hardened forewing),[3] which is distinctly metallic blue, or 
		iridescent blue.
